## Who

My name, is not Bond, James Bond. It's Smith, Alan Smith. Not as glamorous, but that's okay. If you like -- I'd love it -- you can call me Agent Smith.

I'm a blonde, hippie sort, with a love of caring for people. You don't really need to know much more about me, but I'll humor you with some more details.

I grew up on a small, organic [dairy farm in Central New York](http://www.meadowsweetfarm.com) with 8 siblings and 2 loving parents. (Not that the 8 siblings weren't loving, but my parents certainly were with 9 kids.) I became a computer whiz/geek at a young age and thought that was my calling in life. Up until the end of May, 2015, I had been doing computer programming/administration, in one capacity or another, for many years. Then everything changed and I quit my job, but more on that in a moment.

## What

This site is a collection of my writings/stories. That's probably what you expected, so nothing new there. What you won't see coming, nor will I, will be what I write about. That remains to be seen as life happens. We can be happily surprised together. How does that sound?

## Why

Ah, right. Remember how I said I quit my job and everything changed? I hope you do, it was only a couple sentences ago. (If you failed to recall I said that, please consider seeing a physician.)

Well! I quit my job, packed my belongings into my car, took off for a trip around the country, and now I'm going to write about my experiences. That's the short version of the story. If you don't like long explanations, please leave this site immediately and find something more enjoyable to read. I can promise it's not going to get better, this is it. Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you have a wonderful day.

But if you're still reading, clearly you want to hear more, or you're a masochist. One question I've already gotten asked a lot is, why did you quit your job? It's said with a tone of incredulity, as if anyone who turns down an opportunity to make money is, without a doubt, insane. So here's why:

Most recently I worked as a System Administrator on [Heroes of Newerth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com). It's a computer game, very popular in Thailand, and barely known elsewhere. As a System Administrator, or sysadmin, I was partially responsible for making sure the global player base could play the game at all hours of the day and night. Lucky for me, I had a fantastic teammate who could share this burden with me. However, as you can imagine, the work took long hours, and I grew to hate staring at a computer screen. There's something about looking into a light for 8-10 hours, 5 days a week, that drains the soul. Or, as my co-worker and I referred to similar sorrowful things, it makes your light grow cold.
But it wasn't this job that made me want out of the computer biz. It was this job and all the others I've had before it. Working in basements (at least 3-5 of the tech jobs I've had were in basements), staring at screens, breathing recycled air, and dealing with problems that exist only because we created something with problems, takes it out of me.

As a self-respecting, good for nothing, hippie, college dropout, I turned in my notice at work, decided I was going to travel the US, and boxed up nearly everything I own in this world. At the time of this writing, I'm about to embark on a journey around the US, eating at soup kitchens, smiling at people, and hanging out with homeless people. In other words, be what some people would call a detriment to society or a waste of talent. To those people, I'm sorry your view of the world leads you to think that, you don't know what you're talking about.

## When

Currently, I plan on taking a year, probably July 2015 to July 2016, and driving around the US. I make no promises as to whether or not I'll stick to that time period, as I'm sure things will come up as I go. It could end up being a full year, or maybe I get part way around the US and discover I can't, or don't want to, go further, for one reason or another.


I hope you enjoy the ride, it's bound to be an adventure!

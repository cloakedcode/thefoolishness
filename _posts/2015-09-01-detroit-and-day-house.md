The longer I wait to write about Detroit and Day House, the more I don't want to write about it. Not because it's not worth writing about or I have nothing to say, but because the impression it left is fading as I've moved on to other things. After staying at Day House, I visited with a new friend in Detroit and then left to journey North, through the Upper Peninsula and into Canada, around to Thunder Bay. Already I have stories to tell since leaving Detroit, such as the young moose I followed in a canoe, or my camp stove leaking gas and lighting the picnic table on fire, or the loon that was censoring swearing in my dreams. However, those stories will have to wait, I've got to tell you about Detroit.

## The City

I don't think it would make much sense to talk about Day House without first telling you what Detroit is like. Detroit, in a word, is confusing. If you go Downtown, you will find what you expect in most cities: affluent people chatting giddily as they go shopping; or hurriedly strutting down the street, phone in hand; or construction crews tearing up roads. If you look closer, you'll notice the majority of people, the well dressed ones, are white and clean. Now take a jaunt to the East side of the city. Less than a mile from Downtown, you'll look around and see: empty lots where there used to be houses but now there's just grass fields; or black men standing on street corners, looking dirty and disheveled; or partially burned, abandoned, houses; or old stores with the windows missing or boarded up. Hop on over across town and you'll gaze upon: brand new shops selling expensive items right next to vacant lots filled with cracking pavement and plants growing up; or the long-abandoned train station that's getting new windows put in, even though it's a safety hazard.

It struck me again and again, that everywhere I went felt like a different city. Imagine driving around a city where one moment you're next to a Starbucks and the next you're beside a burned out, husk of a house, and the next you're passing a bicycle shop selling wares only dentists and doctors can afford. Another such moment was driving through Belle Isle (the island-park of Detroit). We passed a new playground and mowed lawns, then an abandoned set of little buildings with a far-stretching wall that once kept some attraction from the eyes of people who wouldn't pay the fee to see it, and now the whole scene overgrown into a jungle.

Detroit never ceased to amaze, and I don't think it was in a good way.

## The House

The neighborhood in which Day House resides is called "Corktown" or, more precisely, "North Corktown". It's an increasingly wealthy neighborhood. Today a freight container condo (a small condo literally made from recycled freight containers) right down the street (pictured) costs over $100,000. When Day House was purchased back in 1977, it cost $2400. No, that's not a typo, it really was twenty-four hundred dollars. Around the corner from Day House is one of the three casinos in Detroit. It's so close a stone could be thrown into the parking lot directly behind the casino if you were to stand on the front porch of the house. In front of Day House, and to one side, stand empty lots, a sight, which, I hoped I've impressed upon you, is quite common in Detroit. The difference is, there are no back taxes owed on these lots, and they're worth a ridiculous amount of money.

The focus of Day House is to house women who are getting back on their feet until they are ready to move out. The women are either alone or bring kids with them, and most of the women are dealing with mental illness. Fr. Tom, one of the founders and one of two permanent residents/volunteers, informed me that they used to invite any women with mental illness in, but now they only take referrals from a health clinic. There is not enough energy, or desire, from the residents to help the women find aid for their illnesses, they must already be working with the clinic. The house was at capacity with seven women when I visited, one with two kids. In addition to Fr. Tom, there is also a part-time resident and her dog.

Outside of work in the house, there is Manna Meal, the soup kitchen started back in 1976. It was created by the founders of Day House, and runs six days a week in the basement of St. Peter's a couple blocks away. They serve from 6:30AM until around 11AM. The two days I helped, we served soup, sandwiches, donuts, coffee, and tea. (Not a great breakfast/lunch for someone who can't eat gluten, I tell you what.) I think the meals on other days were very similar, the only difference being what kind of soup and sandwiches. As for my involvement, I made PB&J sandwiches by the bin full, and then I'd stand behind the counter and hand out sandwiches as people came along. You'd be surprised how many people will ask for another sandwich than the one you're picking up, just because it's got a loaf end on one side.

## The Experiences

There are a number of good stories that came out of my time in Detroit. I've got at least one funny one, one mad one, and one mildly scary one. What I put down here will by no means cover everything I experienced in Detroit, it's just a sample. It should give a taste of what it was like the four days I was there.

### The Lost Son

One day, after returning from helping in the soup kitchen, I was quietly sitting on the couch. Into the room walks a visitor, a woman I had seen talking with the volunteer cleaning the house that particular morning. She said "Hi" and I glanced up at her and back down. Normally I'd be a little more friendly and say something or at least smile in response, except I knew if we started talking it would be a lot of me signaling the conversation should end, and a lot of her rambling on. After a long morning in the soup kitchen I wasn't in the mood for another conversation like that. So I didn't really respond, which is why, when she got across the room to the doorway, she turned, and, staring directly at me, pointedly said, "Hi!" Realizing she wasn't going to leave me alone, I looked up and smiled. That seemed to be enough of a response because she promptly left the house.

About an hour later, me sitting at one of the dining room tables listening to stories from the life of one of the house members, the phone rang. The person I was listening to answered the phone. On the other end was the woman I'd tried to stay away from. She was talking about me, at great length. She wanted to know my name, and my eye color. This took me aback. My eye color? As it turns out, the woman was convinced I was her son! You can imagine the odd things I heard on my end of the phone conversation: "No, he's not your son!" "How do I know?" "No, his parents are very nice people." "No, he says he has blue eyes." On and on. What really didn't help was she and I have the same last name, her son has red hair (mine is strawberry blond), and her son has green eyes (my license says blue but every time I look they're green but I've been told they're everything from blue to green to gray). However, I don't know if the description would have matched me so closely if she hadn't seen me. (Note: It's highly unlikely she ever had a son.)

That first phone call was not the end of the fixation with me being her son. It went on for the rest of the time I was there, her calling several times a day demanding that she be told the truth about me, that I was her son even though everyone denied it. I was informed, with regret, that it would likely go on for quite a long time; a similar thing had happened in the past with her deceased husband, but that's another story.

### The Peeing Man

I was being driven around town by a friend, giving me a tour of the city, when we passed a man walking down the sidewalk, waddling. Nothing very unusual about that, there are a lot of people in Detroit -- though not as many as I expected, it's very spread out -- and a lot of them likely waddle from wearing their pants too low. I merely glanced at the man but then had to turn in my seat in utter astonishment. He was walking down the street peeing! Thinking back I'm slightly impressed he didn't wet the front of his pants, but at the time I was outraged. There's a pretty big difference between peeing behind a bush or in a bathroom and peeing on the sidewalk. You're exposing your genitals in public (a crime, and I don't want to see that), and leaving urine in a place where other people might walk through it, and certainly will smell it. Have a little decency, please.

As I sadly came to realize later, that man and his actions were the embodiment of the city's mentality: "It's Detroit". Not a proud, "Yeah, it's Detroit! It's awesome!", but more of a "Yeah, it's Detroit! No one cares!" People expect a certain level of indecency, disrespect, and complacency. It's in the politics, the people, the buildings, everywhere.

### The Gangster

(Warning: This story may cause worry in all parents who read this.)

One night, after Sunday mass that evening and the following dinner, I was standing on the porch, talking with two of the people who had come for the evening's events. A man, probably in his early thirties, close to my height with a thick afro and beard, and a woman, in her mid twenties, with short, dark hair, and an almost constant far-off look. We stood there talking about this and that, and then they discovered I was new in town. As in, I had arrived less than 24 hours ago. After a number of questions about me and what I was doing there, they started offering advice. The man would go on about something such as being careful who you made friends with, and the woman would suddenly shake off her daze and say something in affirmation of what I'd been told by the man. This went on for a while and then the man asked us both if we wanted to get in his van because he had to get something and didn't want to run back to the damp porch in the driving rain. We looked at each other -- well, I looked at her, she looked off at the horizon -- and said sure, why not. (Earlier that night I had decided I wasn't afraid of terrible things happening to me because if I was meant to be helping people I'd be protected, probably only by my faith that God had my back.) This is where I expect most parents to begin imagining their kids in this situation and how they hope they've raised their children to never get in a van with a stranger. Sorry Mom, Dad, I hope you're not freaking out at this point. Call me, we'll talk.

We got in his van, after he pushed aside the stuff piled on seats, continuing our conversations. He was living out of his van and it was a bit of a mess but we found, or made, room to sit. After a time the woman announced she was going bike home, in spite of the rain not having let up, and got out of the van. With a "Bye" to the man and "Welcome" to me (welcome to the city), she left. Once she had gone, the man turned to me and started talking about what perhaps could be called "guy stuff". How he had been hitting on the woman that had left, how unsuccessful he had been, and how I shouldn't ever hit on someone who "flip flops" (i.e. is friendly and flirty one minute, then disinterested, then back on again). As I usually do when I meet someone who does a lot of talking and very little questioning, I nodded here, grunted there, and simply listened. He went on about his baby momma, his kids, his living situation, wanting to leave Detroit, being afraid to leave Detroit because he didn't know any other Crypt or GD members in other cities, wishing he had some money... wait, what? He was very casual with disclosing to me he was a gang member. Being from the boondocks I was slightly alarmed but played it cool. I politely asked questions about the gangs, what were blue and red gangs, which were in Detroit, how did you know who was in which gang, etc. It felt very surreal, sitting there in a van with rain coming down on a street in Detroit, talking to a man who had been part of a gang since he was a kid. I learned a lot about gangs, not something I thought I'd learn from the horse's mouth, and remained surprisingly calm the whole time. Every once and a while an alarm would go off in my head: "What would your parents/friends say?! Get out of the van!" "This man might have a gun in the van!" "How much do you really know this guy? Are you safe??"

We continued talking about gangs, but he wanted to talk about other things and steered the conversation down different roads. I listened to some of the pain he had bottled up -- it's hard to release things when there's no one to listen -- but eventually had to leave. I made my excuses, and after throwing some trash away for him, returned to the house to make a late dinner. The next morning at the soup kitchen he greeted me warmly, and I've not seen him since.

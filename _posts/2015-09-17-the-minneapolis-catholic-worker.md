My time at the Minneapolis Catholic Worker felt all too short, but at the time I was itching to leave. It seems to be a growing theme in my travels that I am not in one place long enough. Because I've been traveling so quickly from one group to the next, I am quite drained emotionally. When I arrived at Sugar Creek I was interested in listening to people for a couple minutes, but then couldn't handle any more. I had to change my schedule or this trip was going to be exhausting, and I would start to dismiss people and experiences. I'll tell you next time what happened when I decided to change it up, and now let me tell you about Minneapolis.

## The City

I didn't get as exposed to the city as I'd like. I did quite a bit of driving around, but without a guide I didn't learn much about the neighborhoods. Minneapolis is certainly bigger than Duluth, and there are noticeable differences between neighborhoods as you drive. For example, where Rye House (one of the two Minneapolis CW houses) is located, the neighbors are not wealthy and mostly black or Middle/South American. The houses are close together and filled with people. If you go North two blocks from Rye House and turn left and travel to the end of Franklin, you'll enter a neighborhood that couldn't be more opposite. The houses are large, with lawn on all sides, and likely only house a single family or a couple. I didn't see anyone out walking around, but it wouldn't shock me if the majority of the inhabitants are white. There's a lot of poverty in Minneapolis and in some parts of the city there are lots of brand new condos for the young gentry (e.g. the gentry from [Target's Corporate Office & Headquarters, downtown](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Target+Plaza+South,+1000+Nicollet+Mall,+Minneapolis,+MN+55403/@44.9738534,-93.275819,335m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x52b33295d66f98d7:0x5646a7ddb535cb68!2sTarget+Plaza+South,+1000+Nicollet+Mall,+Minneapolis,+MN+55403!3b1!3m1!1s0x52b33295d66f98d7:0x5646a7ddb535cb68)).

## The Community

The Minneapolis Catholic Worker, previously known as Rye House, is made up of young people, most of whom are married to each other. There are now two houses: one where the residents are permitted to have full-time jobs without the responsibilities of running a place of hospitality, another (still called Rye House) where most residents work part-time and invite people in for housing. All the Minneapolis CW's are between the ages of 22 and 35, making up 3 couples, and 2 more women.

My first impression of the house, entering through the back door, was a strong smell of feet. Not a great first impression but it couldn't really be helped as the back entrance is where all the shoes go, however, there had been no effort to reduce the stink. One of the next things I noticed was the sign in the bathroom that read something along the lines of:

> After flushing the toilet, please scoop the rain water out of this bucket into the toilet tank until the water stops running.

As I'm sure it's clear to you by now, the house is made up of a bunch of hippies. These hippies once had a joint bank account where they put all their money and took a weekly stipend of $30 each. They have since abandoned that and have separate accounts with a joint account where they put 10% of their individual income. The reason for dissolving the pure "common purse" was not everyone was content with $30/week.

Rye House members, particularly Joe, would want me to mention their newest member, Ted. Ted -- more affectionately known as Teddy -- is a cream colored Shih Tzu and the love of the house. Everyone is happy to return home from work and see Teddy scrambling across the kitchen floor in eager greeting.

## The Experiences

When I first arrived, Rye House was empty. I got a call from Zach, who lives at the other house, and was invited to go out with him and friends to a bar for dinner and watch the baseball game. While enjoying their company over dinner, I was informed that such an occurrence as eating out and watching sports was not a common thing and not to get used to it.

### Dear Will

The next day I took a walk to the Global Market and strolled around the indoor market shops, most of which sold food. After some waffling about which food looked the best, I settled on "Safari Express" and waited in line. While I stood patiently, a man walked up to me and told me he was homeless and hungry. I asked if he wanted some "Safari Express" and he nonchalantly said yes. Will (my new friend) and I were about to order when two security guards strolled around the corner. At the same time the woman behind the counter wanted my order, and while I was telling her what I'd like, the security guards walked up to Will and escorted him out of the building, with very little preamble. I was a little taken aback and the woman asked if we were together. I told her he'd asked for lunch so I was going to buy him some, and she smiled, told me that was nice of me to do, but that "they aren't supposed to do that". They? _They_ aren't human too? People who are homeless are just _they_? That was Will, he wasn't just nobody, he had a name! And Will was hungry.

### The Shelter

A few days later I got a tour of the Salvation Army homeless shelter in Minneapolis, by Zach, the program director and fellow CW, the one I went to the bar with my first night in the city. The shelter accommodates ~500 people and is the largest shelter outside of New York City. On the first floor is the cafeteria and a sleeping area. It's filled with bunk beds, identical to beds you find in prison, each with a number. As you enter the shelter for the night, you're given a number and that's your bed. On the second floor is where men with disabilities (as certified by the county/state) stay. There they're allowed to be on the floor 24 hours a day and are guaranteed 3 meals a day. The third floor is for women only. It used to be rooms with beds and then they'd overflow into the halls and sleep on mattresses lining the hallways. The shelter recently stopped placing mattresses in the hall for safety reasons and now turn away a lot of women. It's the largest shelter for women in Minneapolis; outside of that shelter, there are 15 beds available in all Minneapolis, 15. The fourth floor is for people recovering from substance/alcohol abuse, often mandated by the court. The entire shelter felt very clinical and impersonal. To access different floors you needed a keycard, and upon entering the fourth floor we were carefully watched by one of the staff. I left the shelter feeling a little hopeless and disparaged.

### Fishing

At one point I was invited on a fishing excursion with Joe and Zach. I eagerly agreed and we went to one of the [lakes within Minneapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Lakes_(Minneapolis)). Standing in the water, among water plants and my feet squelching in the muck, I caught a single fish over the course of the 2 hours we were there. However, that small fish was a specie that Joe hadn't ever seen in those lakes. That brief fishing trip was fun, I hadn't fished in probably 13 years, and hanging out, talking about anything, was most enjoyable.

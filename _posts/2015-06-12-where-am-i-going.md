I am sitting on a couch in my brother's humble abode in Indianapolis, as I write this. [I'm excited but nervous at the same time][i-love-cats] about the trip that's already begun. Today I ate dinner with a member of the Indy Catholic Worker, and tomorrow I drive up to Cleveland to stay the night at the Catholic Worker there.

Oh, if you don't know anything about what the Catholic Worker movement is, you can read what [the wikipedia article has to say][wiki-article], or I can sum it up for you: The Catholic Worker movement is made up of communities all over the US, typically serving the poor and needy, or doing political/social activism, and living as followers of Jesus. This definition is based on the little I've read and my own experiences with Catholic Worker communities. If there are communities out there that don't fit this definition, I hope to visit them on my travels.

Where was I... Ah, yes, the uncertain future. I dearly love my concrete plans and far reaching schedules. As my loving mother likes to remind me, I told her one of the things that appealed to me about my Nursing major in college, was that all 4 years of course work were planned out from the beginning. It stands to reason then that what I'm doing now, traveling the country without so much as a planned route, should scare my pants off me. (Oh! Well, I really hope that doesn't happen.) Instead, I have an odd calm about it. It feels like there's a gentle hand on my shoulder, and should I ever wonder about where to go next or whether I should be doing this at all, I'll get a reassuring pat and a loving push of encouragement.

When I think about what I'm doing, or hear other people marveling at my bravery, it occurs to me I'm a little bit... nuts. I panic, give myself a quick pat down to make sure I'm still in one piece, and reprimand myself for doing such a foolish thing. Who would quit their job and become homeless to drive a jalopy around the US without more than a couple days of consideration? Well, as it turns out, this bozo. Then I feel the reassuring weight of the hand on my shoulder, I relax, and all the worry and stress is gone. I love that hand.

Whatever you want to call that hand -- I call it God -- it's very real to me. I don't mean I can reach up and shake it, hand it a cookie/beer, and say, "Thanks very much, you're a tremendous help!" While it is a tremendous help in my life, it's not physically real. At least, not on a plane of existence I experience. However, it is real in the sense that I'm not making it up. It's not a whimsical fancy, though the logical/scientific side of my mind wants to tell me it is. If I was making it up, or it was a delusion, I think I'd have other mental instability. But, even if I am imagining it, what difference does it make when the effect it has on my life is unquestionably positive?

My hope is that while I travel, that reassuring hand stays with me throughout. I have a feeling I'll need it, and without it this trip will be exceedingly difficult. For now, it's the only thing that's stopping me from turning tail and going back to my old life of computer screens and recycled air. Blehk! (That's pronounced: ble-eck. The sound made by a child's ice cream hitting the pavement.)

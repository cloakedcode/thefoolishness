My trip has begun! I write that with excitement and disappointment. I didn't think it would be sad or hard to leave home when it finally happened, but it was. The car repairs took so long I settled into life at home, and it had begun again to feel like home. As someone who doesn't like leaving home, it was difficult to roust myself from the comfort of everything in Lodi: family, a plentiful supply of food, a wonderful living room, and more nature than a person could appreciate in a week. Instead my life has changed to being filled with hours sitting behind the wheel -- much like my work life commuting -- and having no lasting relationships with anyone I meet.

I left home four days ago and headed up to Rochester, NY. Unless you're counting the beginning of my trip as having started two days before that when I went up to Syracuse, NY to visit Unity Kitchen and Slocum House. That definitely counts for something but I'm not sure I'll ever think of that as the beginning, mainly because I returned home afterwards. Nonetheless, I had a great time in Syracuse, helping a strikingly muscular man, Joe, prepare grilled chicken for the guests at Unity Kitchen, and sharing dinner with the family of people at Slocum House. The group there is made up of Father Peter, Pete, Bonnie, and Terese, oh, and Bruno, the dog. Paul also deserves a mention as being part of Slocum House as he's been there for... a long time, I don't recall the number of years. However, he and Peg -- a chef and baker at St. Joseph House in Rochester, NY -- and my parents are starting a retreat farm for Catholic Workers and friends at my home in Lodi.

## Rochester and my first night
Since leaving home I stayed an afternoon at St. Joseph House in Rochester, NY where I was entertained by Mike Hazel and Fig. They did a lot of talking and I had a few questions here and there, but mostly they seemed to hunger for a listening ear. (I thought that odd when they clearly had each other.) St. Joe's serves a hundred meals a day from their inspected kitchen in addition to providing every service they can to anyone who asks. Everything from helping someone navigate the complex social services programs of NY state to helping someone move to a new apartment. In addition to these services they also own an apartment building across the street and have a number of apartments and rooms in the main building. The building across the street (pictured with a young man standing in front of it -- he wanted his picture taken) houses people who are clean and getting ready to find their own place and job. The apartments in St. Joe's are for anyone, most are recovering from addiction.

From there I headed West, along the edge of Lake Ontario, destined for Niagara Falls/Buffalo area to stay the night. I stopped in a park, got some photos, thought about crashing a wedding there, drove to a campground, left after seeing how close together the camp sites were, drove around looking for a place to park and sleep, talked to some RV'ers, got followed around a park by a cop after dark, and eventually ended up in a Walmart Supercenter parking lot for the night. (I think that may have been quieter than my digs the next night, but more about that in a minute.)

## Oh Canada
After extricating myself from my cozy bed and packing up the car, I drove into Canada. It was easy going through Buffalo until I got over the Peace Bridge into Canada and practically put the car in park while the Canadian custom officers took their sweet time. Once it was finally my turn, the officer asked some dumb questions. Well, the questions weren't dumb, but the order was. He continued to pry for information after finding out I wasn't going to stay in Canada and was heading straight for Detroit:

    Him: "Do you have any weapons in the car?"
    Me: "No."
    Him: "sfljv weoi jvzlw?"
    *I turn down the radio and lean out the window*
    Me: "Sorry, what?"
    Him: "Aoiuvw lkjsdfoivn, sdfl?"
    *he speaks too quietly, I'm tempted to shut off the car and climb out, get my ear up next to his mouth*
    Me: "What?"
    Him: "Where are you going?"
    Me: "Detroit, to see a friend."
    Him: "How do you know them?"
    Me: "We grew up together."
    Him: "What's in your vehicle?"
    Me: "Camping stuff."
    Him: "Do you have more than ten thousand dollars in the car?"
    Me: "No."
    *he pauses for a while, types on his computer*
    *I look around, waiting for him to get on with it*
    *pause*
    Him: "You don't have any weapons in your car?"
    Me: "No."
    Him: *reluctantly* "Okay, you can go." *hands passport back* "Drive safe."
    Me: "You too." *leaves quickly in slight embarrasement*

(I wish I was making it up that I said "You too" in response to "Drive safe" but I'm not.)

In Canada I got lost, had to find the "tourist information" center, watched as Chelsea (the attendant) wrote directions very easily upside down on a map, got down to a provincial park, paid for a temporary pass, checked it out, got the pass refunded, drove along Lake Erie, got to another park, did the same thing (pass, look, refund), and parked along the road. There I got an audio recording of the waves breaking on the beach, picked up a pretty, round, quartz stone, and, best of all, peed in the lake. Now, if you're a female, you won't understand this at all. It'll seem like a barbaric act of appalling male indecency; it may be. But if you're male, you'll probably understand the satisfaction I got from it and the bounce it put in my step, and maybe you'll be a little jealous.

## Safe in Detroit
From there I continued on to Detroit, or tried to. Getting back into the U.S., while the line wasn't as long, was still a struggle as the interviews were noticeably longer. This one went something like this:

    Him: "Where are you from?"
    *lean out the car window again*
    Me: "What?"
    Him: "What's your country of residence?"
    Me: *trying not to sound condscending -- he's holding my passport* "The U.S."
    Him: "Where do you live?"
    Me: "Well, my permanent address is 2054 Smith Road, Lodi, New York"
    Him: "Where are you going?"
    Me: "To visit friends in Detroit."
    Him: "How long were you in Canada?"
    Me: "Just the day."
    Him: "So you just drove through?"
    Me: "Yes, I drove in through Buffalo this morning"
    Him: "The purpose of my question was..." *his normal expression of disgust is turning into agitation and fluster mixed with disgust* *gesturing wildly* "Did you drive through or did you stop and do anything?"
    Me: "No, I just drove through and stopped to look at Lake Erie."
    *face returns to usual disgust*
    Him: "How much money do you have in the car?"
    Me: "Uhh... about thirteen dollars."
    Him: "What do you do?"
    Me: "I used to work as a System Administrator."
    Him: *reluctantly* "Okay, you can go." *begrudgingly returns passport*

Good times. Really looking forward to going in and out of Canada a couple more times on my trip. Maybe I'll write out a F.A.Q. with answers and hand the officers printed copies as I pass through, save some time.

Once across the border, it took a mere 5 minutes to arrive at Day House in Detroit. Here I sit typing away on one of six couches in their living room. Tonight, and for a couple nights to come, I sleep on my choice of couch. However, unlike my night in the Walmart parking lot, it will not be quiet unless I wish to suffocate and close all the windows. Outside on the street there's almost constant traffic and the occasional roar of motorcycles as they head for the nearest bar.

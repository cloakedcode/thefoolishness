I have returned and am back, [home on the range][home-home-on-the-range], in Upstate New York nestled in the beautiful Finger Lakes on the Seneca Lake Wine Trail. (Yeah, that reads like the labels on the backs of the wine bottles here, I know.) It has been several weeks since I wrote here last. I would have written sooner but I have been very busy with our family reunion, working on the car I'll drive around the country, getting used to being part of this farm family again, and making preparations for my trip. I started a list of things I need to do/buy/find before I am ready to leave, and I was forced to tape a second sheet of paper to extend the first! It's a lot of work going for a year long trip to places I've never been. Lucky for me, it's the good kind of work, the kind you don't notice you're doing because it doesn't feel like a chore.

My first week and a bit back in Lodi was spent hanging out with family in a lake house. [Insert your jealousy here.] We had dinners on the back porch, sang songs around the fire, went kayaking on the lake, blew bubbles of all shapes and sizes, and climbed waterfalls. If you don't believe me, here are some pictures:

It was, without a doubt, a fantastic time! I'm not sure I've always enjoyed family reunions this much. It was... wait for it... stellar. When it was over, we slept for 3 days.

Once we recovered from the reunion, Dad and I -- Dad's the mechanic of the family -- completed the engine take-apart that had started year(s) ago for the car I'll drive around the US (and parts of Canada). It's a '99 Subaru Forester that my sister, when she made a 'round-the-country-trip, converted into a sleeper car. (Heh, see what I did there?) The back seat was laid down and bedding installed, going all the way to the rear door. She then put black foam in the rear windows and was all set! I'll take some pictures or make a video before I hit the road so you can see what I'll be living in. The reason I haven't left already, is, as I mentioned, the engine is in pieces. The pistons were burning/leaking oil, and once we had a professional take a peak, discovered the piston columns were tapered. The upshot? We have to wait while the pistons are bored, and replaced with new piston heads. The mechanic informed us the bored holes would be larger than the original pistons, requiring we install the "turbo" pistons, so look out!

Now that the car repairs have come to a grinding halt -- oh man, I'm on fire, another car joke -- I'm left to my own devices. In this case, that means finally unpacking everything from my car, ordering things for my trip off eBay, and shooting lots of pool (a.k.a. billiards). Perhaps most interestingly, also helping with the prep for the inaugural day of the Lodi Community Food Pantry. My family volunteered to create the roadsigns for the pantry and spent all day yesterday painting them. (Silly me got a really bad sunburn on the back of my neck, in spite of being in complete shade the whole time, makes sleeping fun...) Today, July 4th, was the first day the pantry was open. We setup an EZ-Up(tm) tent in front of the Lodi Library and put out the donated food on tables. It was nothing like the food pantry in Indy I visited. This was much more like a country farm-stall. You know, the little, white, roofed, stalls with fresh produce (e.g. corn on the cob) by the edge of the road. People came up, we handed them bags, and told them to take as much as they would eat. It was awesome!

Tomorrow I'll likely spend my time listening to LP's, shooting pool, and writing to friends, old and new. Maybe I'll write to you!

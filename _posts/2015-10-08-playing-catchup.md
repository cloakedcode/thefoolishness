Not a whole lot has happened since leaving the Minneapolis CW. Actually, that's not entirely true... a lot has happened but it's been spread out over a delightfully long period of time. I've spent as much time since leaving Minneapolis visiting friends, family, and taking my time in my travels, as I did before getting there. In short, I've achieved my goal of slowing down, taking it easy. It's been a much more pleasurable journey in this mode. I've even had time to edit some audio recordings and upload a bunch of photos (I'll share all that next time). For now let me see if I can give a brief overview of what's happened since Minneapolis.

## Sugar Creek

The Midwest Catholic Worker Gathering, or "Sugar Creek" (it's held at "The Sugar Creek Retreat Center"), occurred immediately after my stay in Minneapolis. I went directly down to Preston, Iowa where the gathering was held. It was very much what one would expect from a grouping of Earth-loving hippies: laid back, no one knew who was bringing what, we spread our food scraps in the field behind the building, sat around campfires singing, held a talent show, and chatted. The only distinctive part about this gathering were the "round tables", and the focus of most conversation was the community lives of the Catholic workers.

The round tables, or round table discussions, were groupings of 7-10 people who chose to discuss topics ranging from burnout to addiction to spiritual practices to racism. The topics were suggested by the anyone at the gathering and then you could pick which you wanted to visit. I chose two: burnout and addiction. The addiction discussion was interesting and a lot needed to be said about meeting people, who come to the worker, where they are, rather than trying to change them or fix them. Mercy is not telling someone who is suffering with addiction that they aren't welcome. The burnout discussion started off with people talking about how they prevented burnout, and turned into people admitting to being burned out or struggling and unconsciously asking for help.

Overall, it was a fun time, but overwhelming for me, having an aversion to crowds, especially crowds where I know only four people out of a hundred.

## Sand Dunes

From there I went East to Goshen, IN to visit friends. On my way I stayed the night at the Indiana Sand Dunes park. I arrived at the park late afternoon and once settled in, I headed for the dunes. As I was about to leave my campsite, I happened to smile, wave, and make some comment to my neighbor about the weather. (You know, typical small talk, the weather, can't go wrong, people always have something to say about it.) We talked for maybe two minutes, and then I went on my way for some hiking and photo shooting. I strolled along Lake Michigan enjoying the water, the sand, and the sun. I took some photos and headed back after creeping on a bunch of people. (Turns out people really don't look up, so if you hang out on top of a dune, no one knows you're there. This was proven all too well when I realized with a start that I had witnessed a woman peeing in the weeds.)

While I was cooking dinner -- mmm, tuna noodles and cheese, yum! -- my neighbor came strolling over from the fire he was stoking and asked if I'd like to join him and his wife around the blaze when I was done with my food. I happily agreed I would and thanked him heartily. I'm sure I painted a pretty sorry picture: my meager dinner over a tiny flame, no fire to brighten the night, and no one to sit with and tell stories. After dinner I joined them around the fire and roasted marshmellows. They were from Michigan and were on vacation, about to head East before going home and back to normal life. They weren't overly talkative, but I was happy to merely sit in their presence and enjoy the fire together. We talked a little about my journey, what did my parents think about it all, how old was I, why now, what did I do before, etc, the usual. Once I announced I should be going to bed, I thanked them and made as if to leave. The man thanked me for coming over and asked if it would be okay if he prayed for me before I left. I consented and he prayed. He was no poet, but his prayer was earnest and he genuinely cared about me and my safety as I went. He was a sweet man. When I awoke the next morning they'd already left for their next stop.

## Friends in Goshen

I finally arrived in Goshen and had a great time seeing people I hadn't seen in several months. It was peaceful to spend time doing nothing, not meeting new people, and lazing about. That's not all true. I did meet new people, but only two. Two I can handle, two I can do. One of those two was a fascinating person who grew up with Pete Seeger as a family/personal friend. She, Sonya, had a lot of interesting stories to tell about her childhood, and recent years of starting college at Goshen College, taking time off, traveling the US and ending up in South America -- I'm still not sure where all she went -- and finally returning to Goshen to finish an undergrad in Biology to become a nurse.

When I wasn't talking to Sonya, I spent time laying around (literally lying on the floor), playing video games, walking, and chatting with dear friends, for a whole week. Very refreshing.

## Family in Indianapolis

_(Note: As I got to this point in the writing of this entry, I had to stop for a couple minutes to let a bat out of the attic where I'm staying. Not sure how it got in...)_

I left Goshen and drove down to Indianapolis to visit my brother Ben and his son Rowan. We had a great time together, at times having pillow fights that went on far too long, at other times reading Garfield comics or playing computer games together. A typical day started with me waking up around 10AM, Rowan and Ben coming home around 1:30PM, Rowan and I playing until I ran out of energy, dinner, playing a computer game together (Rowan would talk about Terraria, his favorite computer game, long before we could even get to dinner, let alone eat it), Rowan going to bed, then Ben and I staying up until 1AM playing Terraria. There were a couple nights when Ben had to work on a grant, and then there were nights when we stayed up playing until 3-4AM. Sshhh, don't tell our parents. Ben, your _mom_ would disapprove! (For the uninitiated, that was a "your mom" joke directed at my own sibling. Don't worry, you're sharp, you'll pick it up.)

I was able to attend the weekly contra dances in Indy, twice. Both times I had a great deal of fun, and if my face wasn't already used to smiling, the muscles would be sore from all the grinning I did. Afterwards a group of us would head out to a bar and chat or play pool or foosball.

Another feature of this trip to Indy was being around for the Wednesday night meal at the soup kitchen. One of the Indy CWers is a large part of it, and had invited me last time I was in town to help out. My hands were not needed for the serving or prep, but I was able to share some time with guests as they ate. Some of them talked, some of them sat silently and then thanked me for sitting with them as they got up to leave. Thinking back, it's heart warming to have been available for those men, and a few kids. At the time, it felt like just another day.

## Tripping to Des Moines

Now I'm in Des Moines, Iowa. I'm staying in the attic of the hospitality house, Dingman House. Here we serve meals five days a week, a "snack" from 3-5PM, and dinner at 6PM. The snack is much closer to a meal than a snack, unless you normally eat salad, green beans with sausage, and chicken and eggs as a snack (that's what it was today). So far it's been a fantastic week here, and I'm sure it'll continue that way until I leave next week. Unless I get arrested. I'll tell you more about the Des Moines Catholic Worker, or DMCW, another time.

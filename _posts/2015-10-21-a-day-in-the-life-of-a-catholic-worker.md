Before leaving on this trip I had romantic ideas about what it would be like to live as a Catholic Worker. Those romantic ideas were inspiring and inviting. Unlike some romantic ideas I have, those turned out to not be far from the reality of life as a Catholic Worker. Rather than fill your head with made up ideas of what happens, I'll tell you about yesterday, a pretty typical day.

## Morning

My day started around 9AM (I'd stayed up late the night before) when I awoke, got dressed, went downstairs, and made breakfast. Another worker, Jack, was in the kitchen acting as Snack Fairy -- the person responsible for preparing the 3PM meal. He was combining cans from the basement pantry, grabbing food from the Store Room -- a storage space for donations -- and cooking it all in the slow-cookers that are popular among the Snack Fairies. We chatted while I ate breakfast, and then did a little morning reading (of a book).

At one point two cops showed up, looking for someone. As you'd expect from anarchist Catholic Workers, those cops were not welcome nor given any information about our guests. They made sure they were talking to staff, gave the name of the person they were looking for, and got very little in return. They left shortly after they arrived. Once they were very much gone, Jack and I talked until it was time for the Tuesday morning food-run.

The worker that was helping with the food-run, Brian, was not around at 10:30AM when we were supposed to leave. I waited for him to appear, and at 10:45AM I gave up waiting and went looking. When I showed up at his house, there he was, wandering around, still getting ready. We left in the big white van. We went first to Trader Joe's and collected several boxes of produce and a couple trash bags full of bread. Our next stop was Whole Foods where we got many banana boxes of meats, produce, fruit, premade salads, microwave pasta, cookies, cakes, bread, and bouquets of flowers. The cargo was returned to Dingman House, the hospitality house of the Des Moines CW, and unloaded. The boxes were unpacked and sorted onto shelves in the front room. Later in the day people would come through, fill a bag with whatever they wanted, and take it home. 

## Afternoon

With the food-run done, we were free until 2:50PM when we'd prepare for Snack. As it was Patrick's birthday, a co-worker, he was lazing about. He played video games and drank while procrastinating on the paper he had to write for college. Patrick left to run an errand, and I took that opportunity to doze in a rocking chair. Did I mention I'd been up late the previous night?

Snack time rolled around, and we all gathered in the eating area downstairs for our powwow. (Snack is served from a table in the corner of the main area on the first floor.) Roles were assigned, we had a moment of silence, and then scattered to our posts. Well, almost. We scattered and then formed clusters of people talking about politics while others went to their posts. Politics is the typical focus of conversation. Some of the workers might argue that philosophy is their focus, but philosophy is only the language they use to discuss politics.

3:00PM, the official time we serve Snack, came and went, and at 3:04PM we opened the doors. (Snack has never been at 3 the whole time I've been here, even though we're always ready and standing around, and it's served 5 days a week.) The lines of people that had been waiting, poured in through the back door for the snack, and others came in the front for the pantry. The food in the pantry from the food-run would be entirely gone by the end of the day. Except the bread, there's always leftover bread. As the throng lined up in front of the food -- hot meat and rice, chicken and pasta soup, and sweets -- I waited in the kitchen, ready to take washed dishes back out for reuse.

Once guests had their food they'd go back outside to sit at the picnic tables or stay inside and sit around the tables or watch TV from the couches. There are some that won't get in line immediately, but instead claim space at a table and once settled in come to get food. The inside activities are usually watching TV, reading the news paper, playing cards or cribbage, or chatting. Frank describes our brand of hospitality as "a social club".

By about 3:15 everyone has their plates of food and is sitting down to eat. Around 3:20 the plates, bowls, spoons, forks, and coffee mugs will start trickling into the kitchen to be washed. Once cleaned I return them to the front room where they're picked up by guests at the next meal. About this time, guests will grab to-go containers from the back room and go through the line again.

Now there's a lot of standing around and more talking of politics/philosophy. From 3:40 until 5:30, not everyone is needed, thus all the idle conversation. On this day, I did a lot of sleeping with my eyes open. While we are idle the guests sign-up for their turn in the shower, and when their name is called, handed a towel and washcloth.

## Dinner

At 5:30 Patrick and I drove off to retrieve dinner from a local restaurant. Typically dinner is brought to us by generous people outside the community who prepare a meal themselves. A lot of them are church groups, though some are families, and all are scheduled and know when they're making dinner. This day a restaurant was donating dinner. We went a couple miles up the road, picked up the Italian dinner (two aluminum tubs of pasta and cheese, and a tub of fried chicken), and returned it home. After unloading it into the kitchen, it was almost dinner time.

6:00 rolled around and I was given the duty of "calling 'em up". The man who normally does this, Eddie, is currently in jail for civil disobedience. I walked into the dining area and called: "Supper time, supper time. Would someone like to invite the Lord to our table?" Almost before the words were out of my mouth, someone called "I will!" The room fell silent, men doffed their hats, and a beautiful little prayer was spoken about the homeless, the poor, and the needy. With an echoing "Amen!" from the crowd, dinner was served.

I rushed back to my place in the serving line -- dinner is served in the kitchen -- and dolled out helpings of the pasta. By about 6:07 the first wave is done. Then the workers grab plates and help themselves to a quick bite. At 6:15PM seconds are served. This often means people who were waiting to take food with them are now served as much as they'd like. Containers get filled and we still have leftovers! Once that's done, we pack the rest into the fridge, and cleanup. The front rooms get swept, tables/benches wiped down, the bathrooms cleaned, the last food scraps put away, the kitchen cleaned, and then once everyone is out of the kitchen, the floor gets mopped.

## Evening

Like I said, this was Patrick's birthday, and we were going to catch up later with him and his girlfriend to celebrate. To pass the time we went over to Rachel Manning, another DM CW house, and watched the SNL version of the Democratic Presidential debate. After that, helped housemates bring in a newly purchased keyboard (the piano kind), and then got ready to go.

We ended up at a little bar where the biggest thing happening was the Cubs game. It wasn't evident how many people were invested in it until the game ended, the Cubs lost, and three quarters of the bar left. We talked, drank, played pool, debated politics/philosophy, and eventually went home.

Once home I ate a snack, read a little more of my book, meditated, and crawled into bed.

## That's all folks

So there you have it, a normal day in the Catholic Worker. Of course, not every day is the same, sometimes I serve Snack, sometimes I don't do food-runs, some days there's liturgy, Saturday we help with a food pantry at a local church, and Monday/Wednesday we don't serve meals and have the day off. On those days, anything is bound to happen -- that applies to all days actually. For example, today I'm going with Brian to look at a car he's thinking of buying. Tonight Jack and I are going to a friends house for dinner. At any moment we might have to intervene in a drunken shouting match or stonewall the cops again.

One thing is for sure, no two days are identical, and I love it.

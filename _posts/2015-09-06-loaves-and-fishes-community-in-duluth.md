My time at Dorothy Day House in the Loaves and Fishes Community in Duluth passed very quickly. I spent as much time there as I did in Detroit, but time in Detroit went by slowly and quietly. Time in Duluth had its slow moments, lots of sitting on the back porch listening to conspiracy theories, but overall it sped by.

I have found that in communities where there are workers present in the house all day, time flies by. If I am left to my own devices and my only entertainment is the house cat, time will creep by. As a result, the latter type of community is not conducive to long stays as I can't easily get a job to keep busy for a couple weeks and then ditch it. However, I can write, read books, meditate, and listen at all places, regardless of how much activity happens between 9 and 9.

## The City

Duluth is a surprisingly beautiful city. I had the preconception that all cities in Minnesota were reflections of the uninteresting inhabitants and thus dull. To my joy, I found Duluth, situated right on the edge of Lake Superior, is quite lovely and the people are interesting to boot. There is a lake front "trail" -- bare feet wouldn't approve the use of the term -- and if you cross the bridge to Superior, WI, there's a public beach complete with driftwood, watermelon rind, dogs, old pallets, and a good chance the waves will reach out and grab your dry feet.

Another feature of being right on the lake, is the cargo/tanker ships hanging around. It was delightful to see them sitting out there and imagine myself a deck hand. The lights on the boats at night was particularly beautiful out on the water. And the low, blaring, horn piercing the fog as the boats would move in and out of the harbor.


All that being said, Duluth is not very big. It's about 90,000 people so if it had a home foreclosure like the one happening in Detroit, foreclosing on 40,000 homes, Duluth would almost disappear.

## The Community

The Loaves and Fishes Community was started as the last stop on the underground railroad helping people from El Salvador escape into Canada. It has since become a community made up of three houses. One houses single men, the next women and children, and the last sits with a lone occupant, waiting for a purpose. Everyone in these houses is invited to stay as long as it takes them to get their own place and find employment.

I stayed in the one for single men (fitting), and was surrounded by ten men, two of whom were permanent volunteers. As usual with men off the street, the occupants struggled with drug addiction, alcohol addiction, and mental illness. The vice of choice for all of them was coffee, and, with the exception of two, smoking cigarettes. Not a smoke a day or a couple at night as a social activity, but all the time. There was rarely a moment when the back porch was devoid of smokers. One of the men admitted he was going through a couple packs a day! I didn't count, but they all seemed to go through a pack a day; they all carried a different pack each day I saw them.

During the day, from 8AM to 8-9PM, the house (a.k.a. Dorothy Day House, I disapprove of the name, but I'll leave that for another time) was open to anyone who wanted to come in and hang out. There's coffee available from the commercial coffee maker in the corner 24/7. If you smoke, you're welcome to head for the back porch.

Come the end of the day, dinner is served at 6 and everyone is welcome. Often people would show up for dinner and conversation and leave again. There were regulars that would come for almost every dinner. (I'm still not entirely sure who lived there and who happened to arrive for dinner along with everyone else returning from their day jobs.)

The thing that made this community unique among the places I've been so far, is the Bike Cave in the basement. Anyone is invited to come and get a bike. Each bike is preassigned a number of hours and the new owner is expected to put that many hours into helping around the Bike Cave, typically helping other people repair their bikes or strip donated bikes of usable parts.

## The Experiences

The most entertaining of the people at Dorothy Day House was a man who would constantly have something to tell you about the government's use of high frequency wave torture, or the New World Order ruling the planet and our only hope of escape is to use energy to break free of their mind control. He showed me devices you could buy and chakra transforming sessions you could purchase. All this was between coughing fits from the chain smoking.

Other than listening to stories, one of which I will likely never repeat to anyone because it was as intensely personal as it gets, I spent my time walking along the water, taking pictures of the lake, and drinking coffee. The night before I left, I was taken on a bike ride down the lake front trail to Superior, and enjoyed a leisurely stroll down the beach talking about the Catholic Worker, hearing more about the Loaves and Fishes founders, and wondering, with my tour guide, what we foresee happening in our futures. It was leisurely for five seconds at a time, and then the water would rush up and I'd endanger my rolled up pants unless I lept into the air. My pant cuffs got soaked at one point and then dodging the splashes was pointless; it was leisurely for the rest of the walk.
